        <p id="info">In 1989, I invented the World Wide Web, an Internet-based hypermedia initiative for global information sharing while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory. I wrote the first web client and server in 1990. My specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML were refined as web technology spread.

 I am Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a Web standards organization founded in 1994 that develops interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full potential. I am a founding Director of the Web Science Trust (WST) launched in 2009 to promote research and education in Web Science, the multidisciplinary study of humanity connected by technology. I am also a Director of the World Wide Web Foundation, launched in 2009 to coordinate efforts to further the potential of the Web to benefit humanity.

At MIT, I am the 3Com Founders Professor of Engineering in the School of Engineering, with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAIL). I am also a Professor in the Electronics and Computer Science Department at the University of Southampton, UK.

In 2001 I became a Fellow of the Royal Society. I have been the recipient of several international awards. In 2004 I was knighted by H.M. Queen Elizabeth, and in 2007 I was awarded the Order of Merit.</p>
